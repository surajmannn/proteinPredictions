# Predicting Protein Expressions using Machine Learning

This Jupyter Notebook uses regression models for predicting the level of expression of different proteins in a given biological tissue image

Uses machine learning models that use training data (images with known protein expression values) to predict protein expression in test images. The protein expression of different proteins in a given image patch is called its protein expression profile.
